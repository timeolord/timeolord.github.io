<hr>
<p>Hi! I'm a student at McGill University studying Computer Science and Biology, with a minor in Chemistry. I am currently working at the Perepichka Lab synthesizing organic semiconductors and other charge transfer complexes. I also have many random hobby projects, including reinforcement learning models, games and apps.</p>

      <p class="sectionContent">- Created a local cluster for distributed computing using Ray and bash scripts to train the reinforcement agents I’ve - created. <br>
        - Wrote a custom OpenAI gym environment to simulate the stock market using real data from web scraped from Yahoo Finance. <br>
        - Wrote another custom OpenAI gym environment to wrap over the game Hotline Miami 2. I decompiled and reverse engineered the game to find specific pointer paths to data that is inaccessible normally, i.e raw position values.<br>
        - Modified an existing implementation of the MuZero algorithm to work on my custom environment, specifically I implemented a multithreading saver that transfers trained model data onto the head node, as the original implementation was not designed to be run on clusters.&nbsp;<br>

      <h3 class="sectionContent">A custom neural network model from scratch  in C++ using only Eigen as the linear algebra library. This was built to better understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks and to learn how to optimize computationally expensive software. Currently only supports feedforward networks, but future plans include support for other architectures such as recursive networks. <a href="https://github.com/timeolord/ExperiNet"> GitHub Link</a> </h3>

      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Reinforcement Learning Stock Trader</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContent">A reinforcement learning model that learns how to trade stocks using a modified version of MuZero written in Python. This project had to manage and organize a large database, along with reward shaping to optimize trading profits. A major challenge was modifying the MuZero implementation for distributed training, with the use of Ray. Ultimately performance of the reinforcement agent only matched passive growth, most likely due to lack of training data, as MuZero is very data inefficient, and thus would not make riskier trades that could increase overall profits. <a href="https://github.com/timeolord/Reinforcement-Learning-Stock-Trader"> GitHub Link</a> </h3>

      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">RL Game Agents</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContent">A reinforcement learning project written in Python which focused on creating OpenAI gym environments from pre-existing games. Stable baselines was used to train the agent as the focus was on the reverse engineering of the games to create the environment. x64dbg was used to analyze the runtime of Hotline Miami 2, to find key variables needed for training, such as player position, death state, and pointer counter. Furthermore to send the inputs without delay, the win32 apis were used to write directly to the input buffer. Issues were encountered with attempting to vectorize the environment, Brawlhalla did not support multiple game instances, while with Hotline Miami 2 action input became an issue as only the active window would receive the agent’s input. Future plans include a total rewrite, and switching to Julia which would make integration with the x64dbg data easier.<a href="https://github.com/timeolord/RL-Game-Agents"> GitHub Link</a> </h3>
