Hi! I'm was a student at McGill University studying Computer Science and Biology, with a minor in Chemistry. I used to work at the Perepichka Lab synthesizing organic semiconductors and other charge transfer complexes. I also have many random hobby projects, including reinforcement learning models, games and apps.
